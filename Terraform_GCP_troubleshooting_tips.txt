Guide: Resolving Common Issues with Terraform Automation on Google Cloud
This guide covers the most common challenges encountered while setting up and automating Terraform workflows on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), along with practical resolutions.

1. Enabling Required APIs
Issue: API not enabled errors
When deploying Terraform resources, you may encounter errors like:

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Error: googleapi: Error 403: The API is not enabled for your project.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Resolution:
============================================
Identify the required APIs for your project.
Use Terraform to enable APIs automatically:
resource "google_project_service" "required_services" {
  for_each = toset([
    "compute.googleapis.com",
    "cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com",
    "iam.googleapis.com",
    "monitoring.googleapis.com"
  ])
  service = each.key
}
==========================================
Apply the changes:

$terraform apply
==========================================

2. Insufficient Permissions
Issue: "Permission Denied" or IAM role issues
Terraform may fail due to insufficient permissions:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Error: Error creating IAM Policy: Request is missing required permission
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Resolution:
========================================================
Ensure the Terraform service account has roles like:
roles/owner (broad permissions for setup)
roles/editor or specific roles (for least privilege)
Grant roles via gcloud:
=====================================================
$gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
  --member="serviceAccount:terraform@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/owner"
====================================================================

3. Insufficient Resource Definitions
Issue: Missing network_interface block
Terraform may throw errors like:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Error: Insufficient network_interface blocks
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Resolution:
========================================================
Ensure that each GCP compute resource has a defined network_interface block:

network_interface {
  network = "default"
  access_config {}
}
=======================================

4. Deletion Protection
Issue: Unable to delete resources with deletion_protection
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Error: Cannot destroy cluster because deletion_protection is set to true.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Resolution:
====================================================
Update your Terraform configuration to disable deletion_protection:

resource "google_container_cluster" "example" {
  deletion_protection = false
}
===================================
Re-apply:

$terraform apply
===========================================

5. SCC Integration Issues

Issue: Security Command Center notifications not working
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Errors may occur if Pub/Sub or SCC APIs are not properly configured.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Resolution:
==================================
Enable SCC API:

resource "google_project_service" "scc" {
  service = "securitycenter.googleapis.com"
}

Create a Pub/Sub topic and notification configuration:

resource "google_pubsub_topic" "scc_topic" {
  name = "scc-topic"
}

resource "google_security_center_notification_config" "scc_config" {
  notification_id = "scc-alerts"
  pubsub_topic    = google_pubsub_topic.scc_topic.id
  streaming_config {
    filter = "state=\"ACTIVE\""
  }
}
=====================================================

6. Logs-Based Metrics and Alerts
Issue: Invalid or missing log-based metric

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Error: Invalid combination of metric and monitored resource descriptors.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Resolution:
============================================
Verify the log filter:

resource "google_logging_metric" "example" {
  filter = "protoPayload.methodName=\"SetIamPolicy\""
}

Ensure resource.type is correctly set in monitoring filters:

filter = "resource.type=\"global\" AND metric.type=\"logging.googleapis.com/user/example\""
======================================================================================

7. Debugging and Logging Terraform Errors
Issue: Debugging Terraform runs
Terraform failures may lack clear error context.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Resolution:
======================================
Enable verbose logging:

$TF_LOG=DEBUG terraform apply

Write logs to a file:

$TF_LOG=DEBUG terraform apply > debug.log 2>&1
========================================================

8. General Troubleshooting
Common Practices:

Validate Configuration:
$terraform validate

Preview Changes:
$terraform plan

Use terraform destroy for cleanup:
$terraform destroy
========================================================
9. Final Checklist for Terraform Automation on GCP
* Ensure required APIs are enabled (google_project_service).
* Assign appropriate IAM roles to the Terraform service account.
* Define network_interface blocks for all compute instances.
* Test log-based metrics and alerts in Cloud Monitoring.
* Use Security Command Center to capture real-time security insights.
* Debug with TF_LOG if errors persist.

10. most important**
to DEBUG startup script/Terraform actions on the VM, check the /var/log/syslog in addition to this ..

$sudo journalctl -u google-startup-scripts.service

All the BEST !!!!
